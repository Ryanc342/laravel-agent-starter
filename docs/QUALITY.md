One row per business domain. The weekly cleanup (docs/prompts/cleanup.md) updates this table.

| A     | Follows every golden principle; tests cover every Action, endpoint and button.            |
| B     | One or two small deviations, each listed in docs/exec-plans/tech-debt.md.                 |
| C     | Several deviations or missing tests. Fix before building more in this domain.             |
| D     | Rules written in several places or untested writes. Stop and plan a cleanup.              |
